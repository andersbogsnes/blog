I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts
of late - <a href="www.talkpython.fm">Talk Python to Me</a> -
and one of the guests was
<a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/71/soft-skills-the-software-developer-s-life-manual">
John Sonmez</a> talking about soft skills in programming. </p></header>

The podcast basically covered how John got to where he is at Microsoft, after having gone from failing all his classes to deciding to turn himself around in order to at least graduate from college.

Out of college, he quickly landed a job with Microsoft. Certainly not because of his grades, but because everything he had done to work on his soft skills.

<p> When he was almost failing class, he started meetups, trying to surround himself as much as possible with other people who shared an interest in what he was doing. He invested time in building a network, specializing in his field and getting to know, and be known, by others in his field.</p>

He became aware that if he wanted to progress as a programmer, it wasn't enough to merely be a good programmer, he had to be the guy whose name popped up when a problem needed solving.

A big part of that soft skill was simply being active. If someone sees your blogpost, then hears you on a podcast, then checks out your github to borrow a snippet of code - that's how people remember.

The other part of the equation is to specialize. Find a niche that you can become the best at - be good at everything else - but the best at that niche. You don't have to be Superman and it's fine to learn as you go, but find your specialty.

These seem obvious in hindsight, but that's the thing. ***It's easy to say.*** The final part of the interview that really clicked with me, was him talking about turning into a finisher.

I'm sure I'm not the only one guilty of it, but I certainly have more than my fair share of unfinished MOOCS, books, classes, articles and others. The money and time I've wasted starting things up and never really getting around to finishing... Always another shiny toy.

I don't promise that I will turn the corner and become a finisher tomorrow. But I have to start somewhere.

This blog is part of it. I decided I want to build a blog to keep me on track to becoming a finisher.

So I did.
